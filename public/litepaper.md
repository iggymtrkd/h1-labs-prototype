# **H1 Labs — Litepaper**  
> Status: Aligned with smart contracts as of 2025-10-19 | **UPDATED 2025-10-20: Enhanced accuracy on level thresholds, ownership mechanics, validator rewards, and detailed economic flywheel example**

### Advancing AI through provable, human‑validated data — powered by blockchain.

---

## 1. Mission, Goals, and Why Now

**Mission**  
H1 Labs is building the human‑first protocol for AI — a decentralized system where verified people enrich, validate, and monetize datasets with onchain provenance, compliance, and transparent economics.
Through our Dual‑Intelligence SDK, every app pairs an agent with a credentialed human, ensuring compliant data for regulated and semi‑regulated markets.

**Goals**  
- Launch a verifiable data economy spanning healthcare, robotics, law, art, and gaming.  
- Align incentives between contributors, validators, labs, and AI buyers through crypto‑native mechanics.  
- Make provenance, credentialing, and compliance default infrastructure for AI.

**Why Now**  
AI models demand trustworthy data. Today’s pipelines are opaque, legally risky, and misaligned with human contributors. H1 Labs merges blockchain guarantees (provenance, payments, programmable policy) with human expertise to create compliant, auditable datasets that enterprises can trust.

We target regulated and semi‑regulated markets — starting with healthcare — and expanding to finance (AML/KYC), legal (privacy/privilege), defense (ITAR/EAR), robotics/industrial (safety standards), and media/creative (C2PA).

---

## 2. Our Edge — Strengths at a Glance

- **Provenance by Design**: Every enrichment and validation emits an onchain trace (who, when, what).  
- **Credentialed Humans**: Domain experts verified via the Credentialing Portal; no anonymous crowdwork for regulated data.  
- **Programmable Compliance**: Domain rules are enforced at the contract layer (HIPAA, GDPR, AEH, C2PA).  
- **Dual‑Intelligence SDK (Agent + Human)**: Apps pair an agent with credentialed human oversight for compliant workflows in regulated and semi‑regulated markets.  
- **Two‑Token Model ($LABS ↔ H1)**: $LABS governs and stakes; each Lab’s H1 token is its vault share, enabling per‑lab economies.  
- **Modular Diamond Architecture**: EIP‑2535 facets make the system upgradeable, auditable, and extensible.  
- **Enterprise‑friendly UX**: SDK credit mode abstracts blockchain for Web2‑style apps.

---

## 3. What You Can Do on H1

- **Create a Lab**: Stake and launch a domain Lab with its own H1 token (vault shares).  
- **Enrich & Validate**: Contribute to datasets; validators with credentials approve quality.  
- **Buy/Access Data**: AI firms purchase verified datasets; payments route transparently to stakeholders.  
- **Build Apps**: Use the H1 SDK to ship compliant, provenance‑aware applications quickly.

## 3.5 Investor Playbook — The Simple $LABS → H1 Path

> **For crypto investors**: Here's your path to H1 Labs yields in simple steps.

### **The Basic Flow**

```
Step 1: Get $LABS          Step 2: Choose a Lab      Step 3: Stake            Step 4: Earn Passively
    ↓                           ↓                          ↓                          ↓
Buy on Exchange      →   Browse Domain Labs    →  Deposit $LABS      →  Wait for Datasets
  or Receive             (Healthcare, Robotics,     Get H1 shares         Revenue flows
                          Art, Legal, Gaming)        (Vault ownership)      NAV appreciates
                                                                            Buybacks execute
```

### **Step 1: Acquire $LABS Token**

**Where to get $LABS:**
- Purchase on DEX (when listed on mainnet)
- Mint via LP incentive programs
- Receive from ecosystem grants (top validators, early adopters)

**Initial Mindset:**
$LABS is your ticket to the protocol. Fixed supply (no inflation) means it becomes scarcer as adoption grows.

### **Step 2: Pick Your Domain & Lab**

**Browse the Labs Marketplace:**

H1 Labs features independent labs across multiple domains:

| Domain | Lab Examples | Revenue Profile |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Healthcare** | De-ID, Imaging, Quality Review | Highest TAM, regulated, premium pricing |
| **Robotics** | Motion Data, Safety Validation | Growing, technical, B2B buyers |
| **Art & Creative** | Game Assets, Provenance | Emerging, community-driven |
| **Legal & Compliance** | Document Review, AML/KYC | Enterprise, recurring revenue |
| **Education** | FERPA Datasets, Research | Academic, foundation-funded |

**How to Evaluate:**
- **Lab Metrics**: TVL, validators, completed datasets, average price per dataset
- **Growth Trajectory**: Velocity of dataset completion, revenue trend
- **Team**: Lab creator reputation, validator retention rate
- **Vision**: What datasets will this lab produce? Is there buyer demand?

**Risk Assessment:**
- Early labs (< $100K TVL) = higher growth potential, higher execution risk
- Mature labs ($500K+ TVL) = proven revenue, slower growth

### **Step 3: Stake $LABS to Get H1 Shares**

**Three Ways to Participate:**

**Option A: Direct Vault Deposit (Recommended for Long-Term)**
```
You send: 10,000 LABS
You receive: 10,000 H1 shares (approximately, at current NAV)
Cost: Deposit fee (0.75% default) = 75 LABS to protocol treasury
Benefit: Low cost, direct ownership, no premium
Entry: Instant
```

**Option B: Bonding Curve (Bootstrap Phase)**
```
You send: 10,000 LABS
Protocol fee: 1.5% = 150 LABS
POL reserve: 7.5% = 750 LABS
Net deposited: 8,100 LABS
You receive: ~8,100 H1 shares
Cost: ~2% premium vs NAV
Benefit: Bootstraps liquidity for the lab, early entry bonus
Entry: Instant, but locked 7 days
```

**Option C: Secondary Market (After Launch)**
```
You send: ETH or other H1 tokens
You receive: H1 shares at market price
Cost: Trading fees (~0.3%)
Benefit: Price discovery, tactical entry/exit
Entry: Any time, instant trading
```

**What You Own:**

When you stake $LABS and receive H1 shares, you own:
- **Fractional ownership** of the lab's treasury
- **Claim on 50% of dataset revenue** (flows as NAV appreciation)
- **Passive exposure** to 25% buyback pressure (scarcity gains)
- **Participation** in that domain's ecosystem

**Example:**
```
Lab has $500K staked → 500K H1 shares outstanding
You deposit $50K → Receive 50K H1 shares
Your ownership: 50K / 550K = 9.1% of the lab
Your claim: 9.1% of all future dataset revenue (automatically)
Your benefit: 9.1% of all buyback gains (automatically)
```

### **Step 4: Wait for Datasets & Earn Passively**

**Timeline to Earnings:**

| Phase | Duration | What's Happening | Your Position |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Setup** | Weeks 1-4 | Lab deploys apps, validators join | Holding H1, waiting |
| **Ramp-up** | Weeks 5-12 | First datasets completed | Watching for revenue |
| **Monetization** | Month 3+ | Datasets sell to AI companies | Revenue flows in |
| **Compounding** | Ongoing | More sales, buybacks reduce supply | Passive gains accelerate |

**How Earnings Happen (Automated):**

1️⃣ **Dataset Sells** (e.g., $100K sale)
   - $50K → Lab owner + validators
   - $25K → Protocol treasury (operations)
   - $25K → Buyback reserve

2️⃣ **Your Share of $50K Lab Revenue** (50% of sale)
   - 9.1% of $50K = $4,550
   - Flows into vault as assets
   - Your H1 shares now back more assets
   - NAV increases: $1.00 → $1.01+ per share

3️⃣ **Buyback Execution** ($25K spent repurchasing H1)
   - ~24,000 H1 tokens bought & burned
   - H1 supply decreases
   - Your share of remaining supply increases
   - NAV appreciates further

4️⃣ **Result: Your H1 Value Grows**
   - Before: 50K shares × $1.00 = $50K value
   - After: 50K shares × $1.02 = $51K value
   - Gain: $1K (+2%) from single dataset sale
   - Happens automatically; no action needed

### **Step 5: Two Paths Forward**

**Path A: Long-Term Hold (Recommended)**

- **Thesis**: Believe in the domain's long-term revenue
- **Strategy**: Hold H1 and reinvest gains
- **Timeline**: 2-3+ years
- **Benefit**: Compounding returns (NAV growth + buybacks compound)
- **Exit**: When you believe growth has plateaued
- **Example Return**: $50K → $500K+ over 3 years (if lab scales 10x)

Year 1: Subsidy + early revenue = 50-100% APY  
Year 2: Revenue-driven = 80-150% APY  
Year 3+: Compounding = 50-100% APY sustainable  

**Path B: Tactical Trading (Higher Skill)**

- **Thesis**: Identify which labs will outperform
- **Strategy**: Rotate between high-growth and stable labs
- **Timeline**: 3-12 months per position
- **Benefit**: Capture upside before market recognizes
- **Risk**: May sell too early or miss long-term compounding
- **Tools**: Monitor leaderboard, validator retention, dataset velocity

Example Rotations:
```
Month 1-3: Buy H1-Healthcare ($50K TVL) → +150% gains
Month 4-6: Rotate to H1-Robotics ($100K TVL) → +200% gains
Month 7-12: Move to stable H1-Legal ($500K TVL) → +50% gains
Result: $10K initial → $100K+ through tactical sequencing
```

### **Key Mindset Shifts for Investors**

| Traditional Crypto | H1 Labs |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Value = Demand for token** | **Value = Real dataset sales** |
| **Yield = Inflation** | **Yield = Revenue from data** |
| **Risk = Protocol failure** | **Risk = Domain not finding buyers** |
| **Upside = Hype** | **Upside = Market adoption** |
| **Timeframe = 1-2 years** | **Timeframe = 3-5 years** |
| **Passive = Risky** | **Passive = Sustainable** |

### **FAQs for Investors**

**Q: Is my $LABS locked when I stake?**  
A: No. You can redeem H1 anytime (7-day cooldown + daily exit caps prevent bank runs). But early exit means you miss compounding.

**Q: Can I lose money?**  
A: Your downside is limited to your deposit. H1 is backed by vault assets (can't go below NAV). But if a lab doesn't generate revenue, your H1 stays at or below entry price.

**Q: Do I need to do anything to earn?**  
A: No. Just hold H1. Datasets selling, buybacks executing, and NAV appreciating happen automatically.

**Q: What if a lab's datasets don't sell?**  
A: Your H1 stays at current NAV. No passive yield, but no loss either. You can exit and move to a more successful lab.

**Q: Can I speculate on H1 prices?**  
A: Yes. Trade H1 on secondary market. But remember: price should track NAV + buyback gains. Wild speculation is prevented by price bounds.

**Q: Is $LABS or H1 more valuable?**  
A: Different roles. $LABS = platform play (scarcity, governance). H1 = lab-specific play (real yield). H1 likely outperforms in bull markets; $LABS more stable in downturns.

**Q: What's the exit strategy?**  
A: Redeem H1 for $LABS anytime (subject to cooldown). Convert $LABS back to stablecoins/ETH on DEX. Can take 7-10 days total.

## 3.6 Buy H1 Button — What Happens Behind the Scenes

> **For developers**: This section details the complete flow when users click "Buy H1" and the smart contract mechanics involved.

### **Overview: Three Purchase Methods**

When a user buys H1 tokens in a lab, they're actually **depositing $LABS into that lab's vault** and receiving fractional ownership (H1 shares). There are three paths to accomplish this:

### **Method 1: Direct Vault Deposit (Recommended)**

```
USER ACTION                          SMART CONTRACT LOGIC
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. User chooses lab and enters amount:
   ├─ Lab: H1-Healthcare
   └─ Amount: 10,000 LABS
   
2. User approves LabVault to spend LABS
   └─ Call: LABSToken.approve(labVaultAddress, 10000)
   
3. User initiates deposit transaction
   └─ Call: LabVault.depositLABS(10000, userAddress)
   
4. Smart Contract Execution:
   ├─ Validate amount > 0 ✓
   ├─ Check reentrancy guard ✓
   ├─ Transfer 10,000 LABS from user to vault
   ├─ Calculate fee: 10,000 × 0.75% = 75 LABS
   ├─ Calculate net deposit: 10,000 - 75 = 9,925 LABS
   ├─ Get current NAV from vault
   │  └─ Example: NAV = $1.00/share (100K assets / 100K shares)
   ├─ Calculate H1 shares to mint: 9,925 / 1.00 = 9,925 shares
   ├─ Update totalAssets: 100,000 + 9,925 = 109,925
   ├─ Mint 9,925 H1 shares to user
   ├─ Transfer 75 LABS fee to treasury
   ├─ Emit events:
   │  ├─ DepositFeeCollected(user, 75)
   │  └─ Deposited(user, user, 9925, 9925)
   └─ Check if level changed (e.g., hit L2 threshold)

5. User receives:
   ├─ 9,925 H1 shares in wallet
   ├─ Ownership: 9,925 / 109,925 = 9.03% of lab
   └─ Can redeem after 7-day cooldown with 0.375% fee

COST BREAKDOWN:
├─ User sends: 10,000 LABS
├─ Deposit fee: 75 LABS (0.75%)
├─ User receives: 9,925 H1 shares backed by 9,925 LABS
└─ Total cost: 0.75% (lowest cost method)
```

---

### **Method 2: Bonding Curve (Bootstrap Phase)**

```
USER ACTION                          SMART CONTRACT LOGIC
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. User views bonding curve:
   ├─ Current NAV: $1.00/share
   ├─ Curve price: NAV × 1.005 = $1.005/share
   └─ Protocol fee: 1.5%, POL reserve: 7.5%
   
2. User sends 10,000 LABS to BondingCurveSale
   └─ Call: BondingCurveSale.buy(10000, user, minSharesOut=8900)
   
3. Smart Contract Execution:
   ├─ Validate price in bounds ✓
   ├─ Validate price change < 50% ✓
   ├─ Transfer 10,000 LABS from user to curve
   ├─ Calculate allocations:
   │  ├─ Protocol fee: 10,000 × 1.5% = 150 LABS
   │  ├─ POL reserve: 10,000 × 7.5% = 750 LABS
   │  └─ Net to vault: 10,000 - 150 - 750 = 9,100 LABS
   ├─ Call: vault.depositLABS(9100, user)
   │  └─ Calculate H1 at current NAV: 9,100 / 1.00 = 9,100 shares
   ├─ Mint 9,100 H1 to user
   ├─ Transfer 150 LABS fee to treasury
   ├─ Transfer 750 LABS to POL reserve
   ├─ Check slippage: 9,100 > minSharesOut ✓
   └─ Emit: Purchased(user, 10000, 9100, 150, 750)

4. User receives:
   ├─ 9,100 H1 shares in wallet
   ├─ Ownership: 9,100 / 109,100 = 8.34% of lab
   ├─ Locked in 7-day cooldown (bootstrap phase)
   └─ After 7 days: can redeem or trade

COST BREAKDOWN:
├─ User sends: 10,000 LABS
├─ Protocol fee: 150 LABS (1.5%)
├─ POL reserve: 750 LABS (7.5%) [for liquidity]
├─ Curve premium: Built into curve formula
├─ User receives: 9,100 H1 shares
└─ Total cost: ~1.5% + time-lock (premium for early access)
```

---

### **Method 3: Secondary Market (After Bootstrap)**

```
USER ACTION                          SMART CONTRACT LOGIC
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. User browses H1-Healthcare on DEX (Uniswap)
   ├─ Contract: 0x[LabVaultAddress]
   ├─ Symbol: H1CARD
   ├─ Current bid: 1.02 LABS/share
   └─ Current ask: 1.03 LABS/share
   
2. User executes market buy:
   ├─ Wants: 9,000 H1 shares
   ├─ Sends: ~9,270 LABS (9,000 × 1.03 + slippage)
   
3. Smart Contract Execution (DEX Swap):
   ├─ Execute swap atomically
   ├─ Send 9,270 LABS to seller (peer-to-peer)
   ├─ Send 9,000 H1 shares to buyer
   ├─ DEX collects fee: ~0.3% (depends on DEX)
   └─ Emit: Transfer(seller, buyer, 9000)

4. User receives:
   ├─ 9,000 H1 shares instantly
   ├─ No vault interaction (shares already minted)
   ├─ No cooldown (immediate liquidity)
   └─ Cost: Market price + 0.3% DEX fee

KEY DIFFERENCE FROM METHODS 1 & 2:
├─ No new deposits to vault
├─ No new H1 minting
├─ User receives existing H1 from secondary holder
└─ Price set by market, not NAV + fees

COST BREAKDOWN:
├─ User sends: ~9,270 LABS
├─ DEX trading fee: ~30 LABS (0.3%)
├─ User receives: 9,000 H1 shares
├─ Price paid: 1.03 LABS/share (market)
└─ Total cost: ~0.3% + market premium/discount
```

---

### **Comparison: Which Method to Use**

| Method | Cost | Speed | Lock-in | Best For |
|--------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Direct Deposit** | 0.75% | Instant | 7-day | Long-term holders, lowest cost |
| **Bonding Curve** | ~2% | Instant | 7-day | Early bootstrap, willing to pay premium |
| **Secondary Market** | ~0.3% | Instant | None | Active traders, maximum liquidity |

---

### **User's Ownership After Purchase**

No matter which method, the end result is the same:

```
User deposits $LABS → Smart contract locks it in vault
                     ↓
                 Mints H1 shares
                     ↓
User owns percentage = H1 shares held / Total H1 supply

EXAMPLE:
├─ User deposits: 9,925 LABS (Method 1)
├─ Gets: 9,925 H1 shares (at NAV $1.00)
├─ Lab total: 109,925 H1 shares
├─ User's %: 9,925 / 109,925 = 9.03%
│
└─ User is now entitled to:
   ├─ 9.03% of all dataset revenue flowing to vault (NAV growth)
   ├─ 9.03% of buyback scarcity gains (price appreciation)
   └─ Can redeem anytime to get $LABS back (minus fee + cooldown)
```

---

## 4. User Flows (High‑Level)

1) Lab Founder  
```
Connect Wallet → createLab(name, symbol, domain) → auto‑deploys LabVault (H1)
Deposit $LABS → mint H1 shares → reach Level thresholds → unlock app slots
Optional: deploy BondingCurve for bootstrap; deploy LabPass for identity
```

2) Contributor / Validator  
```
Sign up → Credentialing Portal (license/ID) → whitelisted for domain
Contribute/validate via apps (Scrubber, Second Opinion+, etc.)
Onchain provenance + rewards tracked to wallet
```

3) AI Buyer / Enterprise  
```
Discover datasets → purchase/license via RevenueFacet‑integrated flows
ETH routed: 50% Lab owner, 25% protocol treasury (H1 pool custody), 25% buyback budget
Auditable provenance & compliance artifacts for due diligence
```

---

## 4.1 Credentialing & Data Validation (NEW)

> **The Chain of Trust**: From verified identity → credentialed contributions → provable datasets → fair revenue distribution.

### **Credentialing System: On-Chain Identity**

Before contributing to regulated datasets, users must create **on-chain credentials** with verified expertise:

```
STEP 1: User Identity
  User calls: createUserId(address, "medical")
  On-chain result: userId = 42
  
STEP 2: Credential Issuance
  Organization issues: issueCredential(userId=42, "physician", "medical", ipfsHash)
  On-chain result: credentialId = 100 (status = PENDING)
  
STEP 3: Credential Verification
  Organization verifies: verifyCredential(credentialId=100)
  On-chain result: credentialId = 100 (status = VERIFIED)
  
User now has:
  ✓ Persistent on-chain identity
  ✓ Verified domain expertise (medical)
  ✓ Credential linked to data operations
```

**Key Features**:
- **Off-Chain Verification**: Credential documents stored on IPFS; only hash on-chain for privacy
- **Domain Tagging**: Medical experts, engineers, lawyers each have tagged credentials
- **Revocation Support**: Credentials can be revoked for misconduct; blocks future operations
- **Immutable History**: All credential actions (issue, verify, revoke) recorded as events

### **Dataset Validation: Proof of Provenance**

Once credentialed, users create and validate datasets with **proof of provenance** on-chain:

```
PHASE 1: DATA CREATION (Creator with verified credential)
  Creator calls: createData(
    labId, 
    dataHash,        // IPFS content pointer
    "medical",       // domain
    0xGPT4,         // base model
    credentialId=42  // verified credential linkage
  )
  Result: dataId = 100 (PENDING)
  
PHASE 2: REVIEW SUBMISSION (Domain-matched supervisor)
  Creator calls: submitForReview(
    dataId=100,
    0xPhysician,           // supervisor address
    supervisorCredentialId=101  // must be domain-matching
  )
  On-chain validation:
    ✓ supervisor has verified credential
    ✓ supervisor domain = data domain ("medical" == "medical")
    ✓ prevents unqualified reviewers
  
PHASE 3: OFF-CHAIN REVIEW
  Supervisor downloads from IPFS using dataHash
  Supervisor reviews for quality/compliance
  Supervisor computes Δ-Gain: (92% - 85%) / 85% = 824 bps (8.24% improvement)
  
PHASE 4: ON-CHAIN APPROVAL
  Supervisor calls: approveData(
    dataId=100,
    deltaGainScore=824,
    approvalSignature
  )
  Result:
    ✓ dataId = 100 (APPROVED)
    ✓ Proof of provenance recorded on-chain
    ✓ Attribution created for revenue splits
    ✓ Event log: creator, supervisor, score, timestamp

Flow Diagram:
  Creator (Credential 42) → Create Data → Submit to Supervisor
                                              ↓
                    Supervisor (Credential 101, same domain)
                         ↓
                    Review offline (IPFS)
                         ↓
                    Approve with Δ-Gain (824)
                         ↓
                    Immutable Provenance On-Chain
                         ↓
                    Ready for Monetization
```

### **Attribution & Revenue Distribution**

Approved datasets carry **immutable attribution** that enables fair revenue splits:

```
When dataset sells for $100K:
├─ Identify creator & supervisor from on-chain Attribution
├─ Calculate delta-gain: 824 bps (8.24% improvement)
├─ Distribute revenue:
│  ├─ Creator: 40% = $40K
│  │  (Baseline 25% + delta-gain bonus 15%)
│  ├─ Supervisor: 10% = $10K
│  │  (Baseline 5% + delta-gain bonus 5%)
│  └─ Lab: 50% = $50K
├─ All payouts traceable to credentials
└─ All splits verified on-chain
```

**Why it matters**:
- Credentials tied to revenue = incentive for quality
- Delta-gain measured against base model = objective quality metric
- On-chain attribution = transparent, verifiable splits
- Immutable history = regulatory compliance

## 4.2 Smart Contract Architecture

The credentialing and validation systems are implemented as **Diamond facets** (EIP-2535):

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **CredentialFacet** | `/contracts/facets/CredentialFacet.sol` | User identity, issue/verify/revoke credentials |
| **DataValidationFacet** | `/contracts/facets/DataValidationFacet.sol` | Data creation, review submission, approval with delta-gain |
| **LibH1Storage** | `/contracts/libraries/LibH1Storage.sol` | Shared state: Credential struct, UserProfile, DataRecord, Attribution |
| **H1Diamond** | `/contracts/H1Diamond.sol` | Router: delegates calls to appropriate facet |

**Key Data Structures**:

```solidity
Credential:
  ├─ credentialId: unique ID
  ├─ holder: user address
  ├─ userId: link to user profile
  ├─ issuer: organization address
  ├─ credentialType: "physician", "engineer", etc.
  ├─ domain: "medical", "robotics", "finance"
  ├─ status: 0=PENDING, 1=VERIFIED, 2=REVOKED
  └─ offChainVerificationHash: IPFS document hash

DataRecord:
  ├─ dataId: unique ID
  ├─ creator: creator address (has credential)
  ├─ supervisor: approver address (has matching credential)
  ├─ dataHash: IPFS/Arweave pointer
  ├─ domain: "medical", "robotics", etc.
  ├─ status: 0=PENDING, 1=APPROVED, 2=REJECTED
  ├─ deltaGainScore: 0-10000 basis points (quality metric)
  └─ timestamps: createdAt, approvedAt

Attribution:
  ├─ creator: who created data
  ├─ supervisor: who approved data
  ├─ labId: which lab owns dataset
  ├─ deltaGainScore: quality measure
  └─ revenueShare: allocated to creator + supervisor
```

## 4.5 Lab Creation & Growth Mechanics

### **Lab Lifecycle & Ownership**

Creating a Lab unlocks three stages:

**Stage 1: Initialization & First Staker**  
Lab creator calls `createLab(name, symbol, domain)` and deposits $LABS into the auto-deployed LabVault. 
- Creator's deposit is converted to H1 shares at 1:1 NAV (initial exchange rate = 1 LABS/share)
- If creator is the only depositor, they own **100% of H1 shares** and thus **100% of the lab**
- **No minimum deposit enforced** (recommended: $10K+ for early viability)

**Stage 2: Growth via Community Deposits**  
Additional users can deposit $LABS into the vault and receive H1 shares at current NAV. Ownership is **fractional and proportional**:
```
Example:
├─ Creator deposits $100K → gets 100K H1 shares (100% ownership)
├─ New staker deposits $50K → gets 50K H1 shares
├─ Total vault now has: 150K H1 shares, $150K assets
├─ Creator's ownership: 100K/150K = 66.7% of lab
└─ New staker's ownership: 50K/150K = 33.3% of lab
```
As the lab generates revenue, all H1 holders gain value proportionally (see NAV growth example below).

**Level Unlocking (Based on Total TVL):**

| Level | TVL Threshold | App Slots | Implications |
|-------|---------------|-----------|---|
| **L0** | < $100K | 0 | Lab exists but no operational apps |
| **L1** | $100K–$250K | 1 | Can run 1 backend/frontend app pair |
| **L2** | $250K–$500K | 2 | Can run 2 app slots in parallel |
| **L3** | $500K+ | 3 | Can run 3 app slots in parallel |

**Stage 3: Bootstrap via Bonding Curve (Optional)**  
Labs can deploy `BondingCurveSale` for accelerated capital raise:
- Users buy H1 shares at `NAV × 1.005` (0.5% premium)
- Fee allocation:
  - **1-2% Protocol Fee**: To treasury (configurable, max 10%)
  - **5-10% POL Reserve**: For liquidity provisioning (configurable, max 10%)
  - **80-90% Net Deposit**: Enters vault at NAV, minting H1 shares
- Bonding curve price increases as more capital flows in, naturally incentivizing early participation

### **Revenue Accrual & NAV Growth**

As the lab generates revenue from dataset sales, the vault's total assets increase, which increases the NAV (assets per share) for all H1 holders:

```
Ownership Dilution & Value Growth Example:

Time T0 (Lab Creation):
├─ Creator deposits: $100K
├─ Creator's H1: 100K shares (100% ownership)
├─ Lab assets: $100K
├─ NAV: $1.00/share
└─ Creator's value: $100K

Time T1 (After Bonding Curve - 200K raise):
├─ New investors deposit: $200K via bonding curve
├─ Fee + POL allocated: $30K
├─ New vault assets: $100K + $170K = $270K
├─ Total H1 supply: ~270K shares
├─ Creator's ownership: 100K/270K = 37% of lab
├─ New NAV: $270K/270K = $1.00/share
└─ Creator's value: 100K × $1.00 = $100K (same, but now owns 37% instead of 100%)

Time T2 (After $100K Dataset Revenue):
├─ Dataset sale: $100K
├─ Lab owner/validators: $50K (flows to vault)
├─ Treasury: $25K (protocol custody)
├─ Buyback reserve: $25K
├─ New vault assets: $270K + $50K = $320K
├─ Total H1 supply: ~270K shares (pre-buyback)
├─ New NAV: $320K/270K = $1.185/share
└─ Creator's value: 100K × $1.185 = $118.5K (+18.5% appreciation)

Time T3 (After Buyback Execution):
├─ Buyback reserves: $25K used to repurchase H1 at market
├─ H1 supply reduced: 270K → ~260K shares (assuming $0.96 average price)
├─ Vault assets: $320K (unchanged)
├─ New NAV: $320K/260K = $1.231/share
└─ Creator's value: 100K × $1.231 = $123.1K (+23.1% total appreciation)
```

**Key Mechanic**: H1 holders don't receive new tokens; instead, their existing shares increase in value as (1) vault backing grows from revenue and (2) buybacks reduce total supply. This aligns incentives for lab success without dilution.

## 6. $LABS and H1 — Detailed Mechanics & Economic Flywheel

> 📚 Tokenomics overview: See Section 5 above. For deeper details, see [`docs/8-h_1_tokenomics_distribution.md`](8-h_1_tokenomics_distribution.md)

This section provides detailed mechanics of how $LABS and H1 interact within the platform's economic flywheel.

### Key Definitions:

- **$LABS (Singleton ERC‑20)**: Platform governance, staking, and lab creation asset. Set via `TreasuryFacet.setLABSToken`.  
- **H1 (Per‑Lab ERC‑20 Shares)**: Each Lab’s `LabVault` is its own H1 token. Depositing $LABS mints H1 shares at NAV; redemptions return $LABS subject to cooldown and exit caps.  
- **Bonding Curve (Optional)**: `BondingCurveSale` buys H1 at NAV + 0.5% premium, routing fees/POL to treasury and depositing net $LABS to the lab's vault.  
- **Levels & App Slots**: LabVault tracks total assets to derive levels (L1/L2/L3) unlocking 1/2/3 app slots.  
- **Revenue Split (Current Implementation)**: 50% to lab owner, 25% to protocol treasury (H1 pool custody), 25% retained for future buyback execution.

Economic intent: AI demand for verified datasets drives onchain payments that flow to Labs and treasury, with retained buyback budgets enabling future buy pressure mechanisms without dividend semantics.

---

### 6.5 Staking & Validator Rewards

**$LABS serves three functions:**
1. **Lab Creation & Deposits**: Stake $LABS → mint H1 shares → unlock app slots and dataset economy
2. **Validation Rewards**: Contribute to datasets → earn $LABS grants + lab-specific H1 tokens
3. **Governance**: Hold $LABS → vote on protocol upgrades (future DAO)

**Validator Economics: The Three-Tier Reward Model**

When a dataset sells (e.g., $100K), revenue is split as follows, with contributors earning across multiple tiers:

```
$100K Dataset Sale → Revenue Distribution

├─ Lab Revenue Share (50% = $50K)
│  └─ Distributed to validators/supervisors based on contribution quality score
│     └─ Paid in lab-native H1 tokens
│     └─ Example (500 validators with equal quality):
│        ├─ Each validator: $100 in H1 tokens
│        └─ Total: 500 × $100 = $50K split
│     └─ Example (tiered by quality):
│        ├─ Top 10% validators: $200 each in H1
│        ├─ Middle 50%: $100 each in H1
│        └─ Bottom 40%: $25 each in H1
│
├─ Protocol Grants (25% = $25K)
│  └─ Drawn from treasury based on merit/governance
│     └─ Allocated to validators who have demonstrated exceptional performance
│     └─ Paid in $LABS (platform token) to recognize platform-level excellence
│     └─ Requires proposal/credentialing review (future: DAO vote)
│
└─ Buyback Pressure (25% = $25K)
   └─ Retained for future token repurchases
      └─ Executed by protocol to reduce H1 supply
      └─ Benefits ALL H1 holders (including validators) via increased share value
      └─ Creates passive appreciation: no action needed
```

**Contributor Roles & Reward Streams**

| Role | Function | Reward Mechanism | Payment Token | Examples |
|------|----------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Validator** | Enrich/validate dataset entries, ensure quality | Proportional share of 50% lab revenue based on contribution score | Lab-native H1 | Healthcare clinician validates patient records; roboticist approves safety data |
| **Supervisor** | Review validator work, sign-off on final dataset, ensure compliance | Higher tier within validator rewards (quality bonus multiplier) | Lab-native H1 | Senior clinician supervises junior validators; compliance officer approves dataset |
| **Developer** | Build apps using SDK, integrate compliance, manage operations | SDK usage fees + app-specific revenue splits (future) | Protocol-determined (H1 + grants) | Healthcare startup builds Scrubber app; robotics firm integrates SafetyFacet |

**Attribution & Credentialing**

Validator contribution attribution is tracked through:
- **Credentialing Portal**: Verify domain expertise (medical licenses, legal credentials, certifications)
- **Onchain Provenance**: ProvenanceFacet logs each validator's enrichment/validation actions with timestamp
- **Quality Scoring**: Off-chain reputation system (future: onchain governance) scores contributions
- **Payment Distribution**: Treasury oracle aggregates contribution scores and distributes rewards proportionally

**Key Insight**: Validator rewards are **real, proportional to contribution**, and **sustainable** because they're funded by actual dataset sales, not token inflation. Scarcity pressure from buybacks further benefits all contributors who hold H1.

This aligns incentives: more valuable contributions → higher reward tier; increased lab success → increased validator payouts; platform growth → sustained buyback pressure → all H1 holders gain.

### 6.75 H1 Tokens — Per-Lab Economies

**What is H1?**  
H1 is **not a single token.** Each lab deploys its own H1 token (LabVault shares) representing:
- Fractional ownership of that lab's treasury
- Claim on future dataset sale revenue
- Participation in that domain's ecosystem

**Example — Healthcare Lab after Year 1:**

```
Initial: $5M TVL, 1M H1 shares, $5.00/share
├─ Dataset revenue: $5M annually (50 datasets sold)
├─ Buyback budget deployed: $1.25M (25% of revenue)
├─ Lab revenue retained: $2.5M (50%)
├─ New TVL: ~$8.5M
├─ New NAV: $8.50/share (+70%)
└─ If buybacks reduce supply 5%: $8.88/share (+77.6% total)

Result: Early H1 holders gain from:
✓ Increasing NAV (more datasets sold)
✓ Supply reduction (buybacks)
✓ Sustainable token economy (real revenue, not inflation)
```

**Why H1 ≠ Traditional Stake-Reward Models:**

| Mechanic | H1 Labs | Competitors (Bittensor, Ocean) |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Value Source** | Real dataset sales | Inflationary rewards |
| **Supply** | Decreases (buybacks) | Increases (new issuance) |
| **Price Pressure** | Buy pressure from revenue | Sell pressure from inflation |
| **Sustainability** | Revenue-driven (durable) | Reward-dependent (temporary) |

---

### 6.9 Bonding Curves — Bootstrap Mechanics

**Why Bonding Curves?**  
Auto-adjusting price pegged to vault NAV eliminates ICO-style pricing risks. Buyers receive H1 shares at a 0.5% premium; protocol fees and protocol-owned liquidity (POL) are reserved, with remainder entering vault to grow TVL.

**Formula:** `price_per_share = vault_NAV × 1.005`

**Fee Breakdown (Configurable)**  
Of each $LABS deposit via bonding curve, the split is:
- **0-10% Protocol Fee**: Routed to treasury (configurable per lab, typically 1-2%)
- **0-10% POL Reserve**: Reserved for liquidity provisioning (configurable per lab, typically 5-10%)
- **Remainder (~80-90%)**: Deposited to vault at NAV, minting H1 shares

**Redemption & Cooldown Mechanics**  
H1 shares purchased via bonding curve can be redeemed like any other H1:
- **Request Redemption**: Burn H1 shares, enter 7-day cooldown queue
- **Cooldown Period**: Default 7 days before $LABS can be claimed
- **Exit Caps**: Daily redemption limit (~20% of vault TVL per day) prevents sudden drains
- **Grace Period**: If redemptions exceed caps, system waits for next epoch or allows backfilling by new deposits

**Example — Robotics Lab Launch:**

```
Day 1: Lab created with $100K deposit
├─ H1-Robotics NAV: $1.00/share
├─ Curve price: $1.005/share (0.5% premium)
├─ Protocol fee rate: 1.5%
├─ POL reserve rate: 7.5%
└─ Level 1 unlocked (1 app slot)

Day 7: $250K total capital raised via curve
├─ New deposits: $250K (from 50 early investors)
├─ Protocol fee: $250K × 1.5% = $3.75K → treasury
├─ POL reserve: $250K × 7.5% = $18.75K → treasury
├─ Net deposited to vault: $250K - $22.5K = $227.5K
├─ LabVault now holds: $100K + $227.5K = $327.5K
├─ Total H1 supply: ~327.5K shares (minted at NAV)
├─ New NAV: $327.5K / 327.5K = $1.00/share (stable, POL doesn't inflate)
└─ Reaches Level 2 (2 app slots)

Investor Experience (Example):
├─ Investor sends: 1,000 LABS
├─ Protocol fee: 15 LABS
├─ POL reserve: 75 LABS
├─ Amount deposited: 910 LABS
├─ H1 received: 910 shares at $1.00/share
└─ Early exit available:
   ├─ Day 1-7: Cannot redeem (cooldown active)
   ├─ Day 8+: Can request redemption
   ├─ After 7 days: Claim 910 LABS back (subject to exit caps)
   └─ If labs appreciate: 910 × $2.00 = $1,820 value at exit

Safety Features:
├─ Price bounds: [0.001, 1,000,000] LABS per share
├─ Max 1-tx change: 50% (flash loan protection)
├─ Reentrancy guards + slippage checks
└─ Admin pause mechanism for emergencies
```

## 7.5 Why Blockchain Matters for H1

Blockchain is not ornament — it is the enforcement layer for provenance, compliance, and fair economics:

| Challenge | Blockchain Benefit | H1 Implementation | Result |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Data Provenance** | Immutable audit trail | ProvenanceFacet logs enrichment, validators, timestamps | Regulators can verify dataset lineage |
| **Validator Integrity** | Cryptographic proof of contribution | Credentials NFT + onchain records | Enterprise clients trust who validated data |
| **Compliance Enforcement** | Programmable legal constraints | ComplianceFacet binds HIPAA/GDPR/C2PA rules | AI firms know data is legally compliant |
| **Transparent Economics** | All payments recorded & verifiable | RevenueFacet splits logged per dataset sale | No opacity in revenue distribution |
| **Security & Trust** | Prevents tampering & fraud | Reentrancy guards, access control, audit logs | Protected against data theft & spoofing |

## 10. Economic Flywheel

The H1 economy is designed as a **closed loop** that continuously strengthens as adoption increases:

### **Macro Flywheel: Platform Level**

```
Lab Creation Phase
├─ Founder deposits $LABS → creates Lab with LabVault (H1 token)
├─ Founder receives initial H1 shares (100% if sole depositor)
└─ Lab reaches Level 1 when TVL ≥ $100K

Community Growth Phase
├─ Others deposit $LABS into vault at current NAV
├─ They receive H1 shares, ownership dilutes proportionally
└─ Lab reaches Level 2/L3 as capital accumulates ($250K/$500K+)

Dataset Monetization Phase
├─ App generates dataset, validators enrich/validate
├─ Dataset sells to AI company (e.g., $100K)
└─ Revenue triggers proportional distribution

Distribution Phase
├─ Lab Owner + Validators: $50K (50% of sale)
│  └─ Split proportionally by contribution score
│  └─ Paid in lab-native H1 tokens → increases vault assets
├─ Protocol Treasury: $25K (25% of sale)
│  └─ Held for grants, protocol ops, infrastructure
└─ Buyback Reserve: $25K (25% of sale)
   └─ Retained for future supply reduction

Token Appreciation Phase
├─ Lab's TVL grows: $100K → $150K (from $50K lab revenue)
├─ H1 NAV increases: more assets backing each share
├─ Buyback execution: $25K used to repurchase H1
├─ H1 supply decreases → scarcity increases value
└─ Early H1 holders gain from:
   ├─ NAV appreciation (dataset sale revenue)
   ├─ Supply reduction (buybacks)
   └─ Compounding effect (higher NAV × lower supply)

Flywheel Acceleration
├─ H1 tokens now worth more → attracts new founders
├─ New labs created with $LABS → platform activity increases
├─ More validators → higher quality data → higher sale prices
└─ Cycle repeats at larger scale with higher velocity
```

### **Micro Flywheel: Healthcare Lab Year 1 (Detailed Example)**

├─ Lab assets: still $212.5K (unchanged)
├─ New NAV: $212.5K / 176.136K = $1.206/share (+6.4% from previous)
├─ Founder's new value: 50K × $1.206 = $60,300 (+$7,300 total)
│  (Gain comes from: $6,650 NAV growth + $1,650 buyback scarcity)
└─ Validator 1's new value: 25K × $1.206 = $30,150 (+$3,650 total)

Month 5: Second Dataset Sale

└─ Validator 1's value: 25K × $1.420 = $35,500 (+$5,350 from Month 4)

Month 6: Buyback Round 2
├─ Cumulative buyback budget: $12.5K (Month 3) + $18.75K (Month 5) = $31.25K
├─ Market price: ~$1.35/share

### **Key Mechanics at Work**

1. **Ownership is Fractional**: H1 shares represent % ownership of lab treasury; dilutes with new deposits
2. **Revenue Drives NAV**: Lab revenue ($50%+) flows to vault → increases backing → increases NAV for all
3. **Buyback Creates Scarcity**: Reserve ($25K per sale) repurchases H1 → reduces supply → increases price
4. **Compounding Growth**: NAV ↑ + Supply ↓ = exponential appreciation (63.4% Year 1 shown above)
5. **Sustainability Loop**: Real dataset sales → real revenue → real token appreciation (no inflation)

## 11. Competitive Positioning — H1 vs The Field

H1 Labs uniquely combines **verified human intelligence, provenance, and compliance**. Unlike peers that focus on compute (Gensyn), model training (Bittensor), or data liquidity (Ocean), H1 targets regulated and semi-regulated markets with enterprise-grade trust.

| Dimension | H1 Labs | Bittensor | Scale AI | Ocean | Gensyn |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Focus** | Human-validated datasets | Model training | Centralized data | Data liquidity | Compute network |
| **Compliance** | HIPAA, GDPR, C2PA, EU AI Act | None | Corporate | Optional | None |
| **Credentialing** | Verified NFTs + KYC | None | Manual | None | None |
| **Provenance** | Full onchain audit trail | None | Internal | Metadata only | None |
| **Revenue Model** | Onchain splits + buybacks | Inflationary | Fiat only | Stake-reward | Stake-reward |
| **Target Market** | Healthcare, Legal, Defense, Finance | General AI | Enterprise labeling | General data | ML infrastructure |
| **Value Driver** | Real dataset sales | Token inflation | Labor cost | Access licensing | Compute capacity |

**Why it matters:** H1's compliance-first approach opens regulated markets (healthcare TAM ~$200B+ in data licensing) that competitors cannot access. Programmable compliance means SDKs launch in regulated sectors without custom legal wrangling.

## 12. Technical Features (Selected)

- **Reentrancy Guards:** Shared via `LibH1Storage.reentrancyStatus` where needed (e.g., `RevenueFacet`).  
- **Upgradeable by Facet:** New domains or policy changes can be added without migrating state.  
- **Guardian Controls:** Cooldowns, daily exit caps, and pause mechanisms at the vault level.  
- **Security & Introspection:** Standard Diamond Loupe, Ownership, Security facets.
- **Price Bounds Protection:** Bonding curve prevents price manipulation via MIN/MAX bounds and 50% max change per tx.
- **Pause Mechanism:** Emergency admin controls for security incidents.

---

## 13. Developer SDK (At a Glance)

- **Dual‑Intelligence Orchestration (Agent + Human)**: Built‑in co‑workflow primitives (assignment, handoff, review), human sign‑off, and audit trails.  
- **Identity & Credential**: Integrate credential checks for validators.  
- **Compliance**: Bind HIPAA/GDPR/AEH/C2PA policies per dataset/lab for regulated and semi‑regulated markets.  
- **Provenance Hooks**: Record enrichment/validation events onchain.  
- **Revenue & Splits**: Simple APIs aligned with `RevenueFacet`.  
- **Credit Mode**: Fiat‑friendly abstraction that still settles onchain.

### Dual‑Intelligence Dataflow (Δ‑Gain → Bundles → Buybacks)
1) App selects a base model (partner or BYO) via SDK adapters.  
2) Agent executes; credentialed human reviews and signs.  
3) SDK computes **Δ‑Gain** (supervised improvement vs declared base) and records provenance + attribution.  
4) H1 aggregates Δ‑Gain into dataset bundles and sells/licenses them.  
5) Revenue triggers buybacks that route to the originating Labs per policy, creating buy pressure for their H1 tokens.

---

## 14. Tokenomics (Lite)

### Roles
- **$LABS holders**: Stake, govern, seed labs, and participate in platform‑level value.  
- **H1 holders (per lab)**: Hold fractional shares of a lab's backing and exposure to its dataset economy.  

### Flows
```
Stake/Deposit $LABS → Mint H1 → Enrich/Validate → Dataset Sale →
RevenueFacet Split (50/25/25) → Treasury custody + Buyback budget
```

Notes (current state):  
- Revenue is accepted as ETH and split immediately; buybacks are not automated yet (treasury event stubs exist).  
- Lab creation does not burn $LABS; scarcity accrues via demand, treasury custody, and future buyback execution.

---

## 15. Use Cases (Initial)

- **Healthcare**: Scrubber (de‑identification), Second Opinion+ (AI‑human consultation), Imaging annotation.  
- **Creative & Gaming**: Provenance frameworks for art and game assets (C2PA‑aligned), attribution and licensing onchain.  
- **Robotics & Industrial**: Motion/vision datasets with validated safety metadata.
- **Legal & Financial**: Compliance-verified datasets (GDPR, AML/KYC aligned).
- **Education & Research**: FERPA-compliant educational datasets with attribution.

---

## 16. Roadmap (Condensed)

| Phase | Milestone | Highlights |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Prototype | Testnet diamond + UI demo | LABS set, createLab, auto‑vault, deposits/redemptions |
| MVP | Provenance + Revenue flows | Credential gating, RevenueFacet splits, initial SDK hooks |
| Post‑MVP | Governance + Credits | DAO/Compliance upgrades, Credit mode, explorer & analytics |

---

## 17. Risks & Mitigations (Brief)

- **Regulatory**: Programmable compliance facets; credential gating; audit logs.  
- **Liquidity**: POL/treasury custody and buyback budget design; exit caps and cooldowns.  
- **Security**: Standard diamond controls, guards, and progressive audits.
- **Adoption**: Validator network effects + partnership incentives; credentialing portal lowers barriers.

## 17.5 H1 Token Mechanics — Frequently Asked Questions

### **H1 Token Supply & Creation**

**Q: How many H1 tokens are issued when a lab is created?**  
A: H1 tokens are minted on a 1:1 basis against $LABS deposits at the current Net Asset Value (NAV):
```
Scenario 1 (Lab Created):
├─ Founder deposits: $100,000 LABS
├─ Vault assets: $100,000
├─ H1 supply: 100,000 shares (1:1 at NAV $1.00)
├─ Founder's ownership: 100% (100K / 100K)
└─ Each share backed by: $1.00 LABS

Scenario 2 (Community Joins):
├─ New depositor adds: $50,000 LABS
├─ Vault assets: $150,000
├─ H1 supply: 150,000 shares
├─ Original depositor's ownership: 66.7% (100K / 150K)
├─ New depositor's ownership: 33.3% (50K / 150K)
└─ Each share now backed by: $1.00 LABS (unchanged NAV)
```

**Q: Is there a maximum H1 supply per lab?**  
A: No hard cap. H1 supply is capped only by the total $LABS in existence. In practice, each lab's H1 supply grows with deposits and shrinks with redemptions and buybacks. Supply is always backed by vault assets (never inflated).

**Q: How does the NAV (Net Asset Value) change?**  
A: NAV = Total Vault Assets / Total H1 Shares Outstanding

NAV increases when:
- Dataset revenue flows into the vault (50% of sales)
- Validator rewards accrue to vault

NAV stays same when:
- New deposits arrive (new shares minted equal to deposit amount)
- New H1 holders join

NAV increases further when:
- Buybacks execute (H1 supply decreases, same assets back fewer shares)

### **Buying, Selling, and Trading H1**

**Q: How much does it cost to buy H1 tokens?**  
A: Three pricing models:

1. **Direct Vault Deposit**: Cost = NAV + deposit fee (0.75% default)
   ```
   You send: $10,000 LABS
   Fee: 75 LABS (0.75%)
   You receive: ~9,900 H1 shares at $1.00/share NAV
   Net cost: 0.75% premium
   ```

2. **Bonding Curve** (bootstrap phase): Cost = NAV × 1.005 + protocol fee
   ```
   You send: $10,000 LABS
   Curve price: NAV × 1.005 = $1.005/share
   Protocol fee: 1-2% deducted
   POL reserve: 5-10% reserved
   You receive: ~8,000-8,500 H1 shares
   Net cost: ~2% premium (0.5% curve + 1.5% fee)
   ```

3. **Secondary Market** (after launch): Cost = Market price
   ```
   You send: $10,000 in ETH or other tokens
   Price: Set by market (often trades at NAV ± sentiment)
   Trading fee: ~0.3% (DEX-dependent)
   You receive: H1 shares at market price
   Net cost: Variable (can be discount or premium to NAV)
   ```

**Q: Can I trade H1 tokens between labs?**  
A: Yes. Each lab's H1 is a separate ERC-20 token. You can:
- Sell H1-Healthcare for stablecoins
- Use stablecoins to buy H1-Robotics
- Or swap directly H1-Healthcare ↔ H1-Robotics on DEX

This enables portfolio rebalancing and tactical rotation.

**Q: What are the fees when I unstake/redeem H1?**  
A: Two phases:

1. **Redemption Request**: Costs nothing
   ```
   You burn: 50,000 H1 shares
   Fee: None at request time
   Status: Locked for 7 days (cooldown)
   ```

2. **Redemption Claim** (after 7 days): Redemption fee applied
   ```
   You receive: (shares × NAV) - redemption fee
   Redemption fee: 0.375% default (can be adjusted by admin)
   Example: 50K shares × $1.00 = $50,000
            Minus fee (0.375%): $187.50
            You get: $49,812.50
   Subject to: Daily exit caps (20% of TVL per day)
   ```

### **Ownership & Governance**

**Q: Can one person own all H1 tokens in a lab?**  
A: Yes, initially. If you're the sole depositor, you own 100% of that lab's H1. As others join:
- Your H1 ownership dilutes
- Your H1 value per share remains unchanged (if NAV stable)
- Your % ownership decreases, but your absolute value stays same

Example:
```
Time 0: You deposit $100K → 100% ownership
Time 1: Others deposit $100K → You own 50%
        But your H1 value: still $100K (50% × $200K vault)
Time 2: Lab generates revenue → Vault grows
        Your H1 value: $100K × (NAV appreciation + buyback gains)
```

**Q: Is there a maximum amount of H1 one person can hold?**  
A: No. A single depositor could theoretically own 100% of a lab's H1 if they're the only staker. Ownership is purely proportional to shares held.

**Q: Does H1 ownership confer governance rights?**  
A: Currently: No. H1 is purely a claim on revenue and vault assets.  
Future: If protocol upgrades to governance, H1 holders may receive voting rights proportional to their shares.

### **Revenue & Yield Mechanics**

**Q: How do I earn returns on H1?**  
A: Passively, through three mechanisms:

1. **NAV Appreciation** (50% of dataset revenue)
   ```
   Lab generates $100K dataset sale
   $50K flows to vault → increases assets
   Your claim: (your %) × $50K
   Happens automatically; you hold and gain value
   ```

2. **Buyback Scarcity** (25% of dataset revenue)
   ```
   $25K allocated for H1 buybacks
   Protocol repurchases H1 at market price
   Reduces total supply → your % ownership increases
   NAV multiplies by scarcity effect (no action needed)
   ```

3. **Compounding** (NAV growth × scarcity)
   ```
   Month 1: 1 dataset sale → NAV $1.00 → $1.05 (+5%)
   Month 2: 1 dataset sale → NAV $1.05 → $1.10 (+4.8%, on higher base)
   Month 3: Same revenue, higher NAV → +4.8% on new base
   Over time: Exponential growth (50% + 25% = 75% revenue boost compounds)
   ```

**Q: What's a realistic APY for H1 holders?**  
A: Depends on lab and phase:

| Phase | Revenue Condition | Realistic APY | Driver |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| **Year 1** | Early + subsidies | 50-200% | Subsidies + early revenue |
| **Year 1-2** | Revenue ramping | 80-150% | Dataset sales + buybacks |
| **Year 2+** | Sustainable | 50-100% | Real revenue (sustainable long-term) |

These are NOT guaranteed. Labs that fail to generate revenue will have 0% APY.

### **Risk & Downside Protection**

**Q: What's my downside if a lab fails?**  
A: Your maximum loss is limited to your initial deposit:
```
You deposit: $50,000 LABS
Worst case: Lab never generates revenue
Your H1 value: Stays at $50,000 (NAV = assets / shares)
You can redeem: $50,000 LABS back (after cooldown)
Your loss: Fees only (~0.375% redemption fee = $187.50)
```

H1 is backed by real assets (your deposited $LABS), so it cannot go below NAV.

**Q: Can H1 go to zero?**  
A: No. H1 is always backed by vault assets. Minimum value = NAV of remaining assets.

**Q: What happens if protocol gets hacked?**  
A: Vault assets are protected by:
- Reentrancy guards (prevents double-spending attacks)
- Access controls (only admin can withdraw for valid reasons)
- Audit-standard safety practices
- Insurance considerations (future, if adopted)

Your $LABS stay in the vault. Worst case: temporary freeze, not permanent loss.

### **Liquidity & Exit**

**Q: Can I exit quickly if I need my money?**  
A: With delays:
```
Time 0: You request redemption
Time 0-7: Cooldown period (can cancel during this time)
Time 7+: You claim redemption (subject to daily exit caps)
Time 10-14: Likely full redemption complete (if within daily cap)
Total timeline: 7-14 days typically
```

To exit faster: Sell H1 on secondary market (instant, but at market price, not NAV).

**Q: What are exit caps?**  
A: Daily redemption limit to prevent bank runs:
```
Lab vault TVL: $500,000
Daily exit cap: 20% of TVL = $100,000/day
If you want to redeem: $50,000
Status: Approved (within cap)

If many people redeem: $100,000/day max
Your redemption: Queued until next day if exceeds cap
```

Prevents cascading failures; ensures vault stability.

**Q: Can I swap H1 for stablecoins instantly?**  
A: Yes, on secondary market:
```
You hold: 50,000 H1-Healthcare
You trade: H1 → USDC on Uniswap (instant)
You get: ~50,000 × current H1 price in USDC
You send: USDC → ETH or bank (DEX-dependent)
Total time: 5-15 minutes (no cooldown)
```

But vault redemption path (cooler but cheaper fees) takes 7+ days.

### **H1 vs $LABS**

**Q: Should I buy $LABS or H1?**  
A: Different risk/reward:

| Factor | $LABS | H1 |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **Yield** | None (no inflation) | Yes (real revenue) |
| **Risk** | Platform-level | Lab-specific |
| **Upside** | Demand + scarcity | Revenue compounding |
| **Best for** | Long-term hold | Active investors |
| **Downside** | Adoption fails | Lab doesn't execute |

Typical allocation: 30% $LABS (platform hedge) + 70% H1 (yield focus).

**Q: Is H1 leveraged $LABS?**  
A: No leverage. H1 can outgrow $LABS because:
- H1 = real revenue yield (sustainable)
- $LABS = scarcity only (no yield)
- H1 compounds (NAV + buyback effects)
- $LABS appreciates slower (demand-driven)

Think: H1 = equity in specific lab; $LABS = platform governance token.

## 18. Closing

H1 Labs unites verifiable human expertise with transparent token economics. By making provenance, credentialing, and compliance the substrate for AI data, we unlock trustworthy, enterprise‑grade datasets — and a sustainable crypto economy that rewards the people who create real intelligence.

The dual-token model ($LABS + H1), combined with revenue-driven buybacks and level-based app slots, creates a self-reinforcing flywheel where early adopters and high-quality validators are rewarded proportionally. This is not speculative tokenomics — it is provable economics tied to real dataset sales in regulated markets.
