# Lab Creation Process - Improvements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the Prototype page with comprehensive lab creation validation, level display, and user lab management features.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Minimum Stake Validation (100k LABS)**

#### UI Validation Display
- Added real-time display of current staked LABS balance
- Shows "Projected Lab Level" based on current stake
- Clear warning message when insufficient staked LABS
- Level threshold reference chart (Level 1: 100k, Level 2: 250k, Level 3: 500k)

**Location**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` lines 992-1020
- Current Staked balance display
- Projected Lab Level indicator
- Destructive alert box when balance insufficient
- Level threshold reference

#### OnChain Validation
- Added check in `handleCreateLab()` function before transaction
- Returns early with toast error if insufficient stake
- Logs detailed error message to activity log
- Shows how many additional LABS needed to create lab

**Location**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` lines 378-384

### 2. **Lab Level Display**

#### Pre-Creation Display
- Shows calculated lab level BEFORE creating lab
- Based on current staked LABS amount
- Uses smart contract thresholds:
  - Level 1: 100,000 LABS
  - Level 2: 250,000 LABS  
  - Level 3: 500,000 LABS

**Location**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` lines 112-127
```typescript
const calculateLabLevel = (stakedAmount: number): number => {
  if (stakedAmount >= LEVEL3_THRESHOLD) return 3;
  if (stakedAmount >= LEVEL2_THRESHOLD) return 2;
  if (stakedAmount >= LEVEL1_THRESHOLD) return 1;
  return 0;
};
```

#### Post-Creation Display
- Shows lab level in success message
- Includes lab level in activity log
- Level badge displayed in "Your Created Labs" section

**Location**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` lines 392-393, 446-448

### 3. **User's Created Labs Section**

#### New Section Features
- Appears at bottom of page (above progress banner)
- Only shows when user has created at least one lab
- Beautiful card-based grid layout (1 col on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop)

#### Lab Card Displays
Each lab card shows:
- **Lab Name** with bold title
- **Lab Symbol** in smaller text
- **Lab Level Badge** in top right corner
- **Lab ID** (numeric identifier)
- **Domain** (medical, healthcare, research, etc.)
- **Creation Time** (human-readable date & time)
- **Vault Address** (clickable link to block explorer)

**Location**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` lines 1323-1384

#### Technical Implementation
- New state: `userCreatedLabs: CreatedLab[]`
- Interface `CreatedLab` tracks: labId, name, symbol, domain, vaultAddress, createdAt
- Labs added to array when `LabCreated` event is parsed
- Vault address extracted from event data
- Sorted by most recent first (prepend pattern)

### 4. **Code Constants**

Added configurable threshold constants:
```typescript
const MIN_STAKE_FOR_LAB = 100_000;      // 100k LABS
const LEVEL1_THRESHOLD = 100_000;        // 100k LABS
const LEVEL2_THRESHOLD = 250_000;        // 250k LABS
const LEVEL3_THRESHOLD = 500_000;        // 500k LABS
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before Lab Creation
1. User sees current staked balance
2. Projected lab level displayed (or "No Level (need 100k+)")
3. Level thresholds shown as reference
4. If insufficient stake: red warning box appears

### During Lab Creation
1. Form validation checks minimum stake onchain
2. If insufficient: Error toast + activity log entry
3. If sufficient: Proceeds with lab creation
4. Activity log shows calculated lab level

### After Lab Creation
1. Success toast includes lab level
2. Activity log confirms level
3. New lab card appears in "Your Created Labs" section
4. All lab details immediately visible:
   - Name, symbol, domain
   - Lab level badge
   - Lab ID
   - Creation timestamp
   - Vault address (block explorer link)

## UI Components Added

### Stake Section Enhancements
- **Current Staked Display**: Shows user's total staked LABS
- **Projected Level Indicator**: Dynamic level or "No Level" message
- **Validation Alert**: Only shows if insufficient stake
- **Threshold Reference**: Shows all 3 level thresholds

### Created Labs Section
- **Section Header**: Title with count
- **Lab Cards**: Beautiful grid cards showing all details
- **Level Badge**: Primary colored badge with level number
- **Domain Badge**: Outlined badge showing domain
- **Vault Link**: Truncated address with block explorer link

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
1. **Insufficient Balance**: Shows specific amount needed
2. **OnChain Check**: Double-validation before transaction
3. **Event Parsing**: Safely extracts vault address from logs
4. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications + activity log

### Edge Cases Handled
- No staked labs (shows "0")
- No level qualified (shows "No Level (need 100k+)")
- Empty created labs (section doesn't display)
- Multiple labs (plural/singular text)
- Vault address may be missing (conditional rendering)

## Technical Details

### Smart Contract Integration
- Uses `calculateLabLevel()` matching LabVault.sol logic
- Thresholds match on-chain `LEVEL1`, `LEVEL2`, `LEVEL3` constants
- Reads staked balance from contract
- Parses `LabCreated` event for lab ID and vault address

### State Management
```typescript
interface CreatedLab {
  labId: number;
  name: string;
  symbol: string;
  domain: string;
  vaultAddress: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

const [userCreatedLabs, setUserCreatedLabs] = useState<CreatedLab[]>([]);
```

### Event Parsing
```typescript
const iface = new ethers.Interface(LABSCoreFacet_ABI);
const decoded = iface.parseLog(labCreatedEvent);
vaultAddress = decoded.args[5]; // 6th parameter
```

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` - Main implementation
  - Added state variables (lines 100-110)
  - Added level calculation (lines 112-127)
  - Enhanced handleCreateLab() (lines 377-384)
  - Added UI display in stake section (lines 992-1020)
  - Added created labs section (lines 1323-1384)

## Future Enhancements
- Load existing labs from on-chain data on page load
- Allow filtering/sorting of created labs
- Show lab vault TVL (total value locked)
- Add deposit button per lab
- Show lab statistics (datasets created, revenue generated)
- Export lab list as CSV
