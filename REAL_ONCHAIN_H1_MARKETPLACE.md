---

### **2. Updated Marketplace State** ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` (Lines 150-160)

```typescript
const [allLabsForMarketplace, setAllLabsForMarketplace] = useState<Array<{
  labId: number;
  name: string;
  symbol: string;
  domain: string;
  h1Price: string;
  tvl: string;
  curveAddress: string;
  ownerAddress: string;
  vaultAddress: string;
}>>([]);
```

---

### **3. Added loadMarketplaceLabs Function** ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` (Lines 990-1066)

```typescript
const loadMarketplaceLabs = async () => {
  // Fetches all labs from Blockscout API
  // For each lab:
  //   - Gets curve address from diamond
  //   - Gets TVL from vault contract
  //   - Gets H1 price from bonding curve (if deployed)
  // Updates state with real data
}
```

**Features**:
- Fetches real lab events from blockchain
- Queries curve addresses from diamond contract
- Gets TVL from LabVault contracts

### **4. Added handleTradeH1 Function** ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` (Lines 1069-1141)

```typescript
const handleTradeH1 = async (labId: number, action: 'buy' | 'sell') => {
  // Buy H1 tokens with LABS:
  //   1. Approve LABS spending
  //   2. Call curve.buy() with LABS amount
  //   3. Receive H1 shares
  // Refreshes marketplace after trade
}
```

**Features**:
- Validates wallet connection and amounts
- Checks if bonding curve is deployed
- Two-step process: Approve ‚Üí Buy
- Uses LABS tokens (not ETH)
- Shows progress in activity log
- Refreshes marketplace data after purchase

---

### **5. Replaced Demo Cards with Real Data** ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` (Lines 2033-2157)

**Before**: 3 hardcoded demo cards (Healthcare, Biotech, Finance) with fake ETH prices

**After**: Dynamic rendering of all real labs from blockchain

```typescript
{allLabsForMarketplace.length === 0 ? (
  <Card>No labs available yet. Create the first lab!</Card>
) : (
  <div className="grid gap-4 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
    {allLabsForMarketplace.map((lab) => (
      <Card key={lab.labId}>
        {/* Real lab data */}
        <h4>{lab.name}</h4>
        <p>{lab.domain}</p>
        <p>H1 Price: {lab.h1Price} LABS</p>
        <p>TVL: {lab.tvl} LABS</p>
        {/* Buy/Sell interface or Deploy button */}
      </Card>
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

**Features**:
- Shows real lab names, symbols, domains
- Displays **H1 price in LABS** (not ETH)
- Shows actual TVL from vault
- Shows "Deploy Bonding Curve" button if not deployed (only to owner)
- Shows Buy/Sell interface if curve is deployed
- Real-time trading with blockchain

---

### **6. Updated Marketplace Info** ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` (Lines 2159-2167)

**Before**:
```
üìä H1 tokens are minted via bonding curves. Price increases with TVL.
```

**After**:
```
üìä Trade H1 tokens using LABS. Deploy a bonding curve to enable trading.
üí∞ H1 holders earn % of dataset sale revenue via buybacks.
üéØ First buyers get lowest prices. Price based on vault TVL + 0.5% premium.
üîß Lab Owners: Deploy bonding curves for your labs to enable H1 trading markets.
```

**What**: Updated to reflect LABS-based trading and curve deployment

---

### **7. Auto-Refresh on Actions** ‚úÖ

**Added refresh calls after**:
- Lab creation (Line 577)
- Bonding curve deployment (Line 985)
- H1 token purchase (Line 1127)

**Code**:
```typescript
await loadMarketplaceLabs();
```

**What**: Ensures marketplace always shows latest blockchain data

---

### **8. Updated useEffect** ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/pages/Prototype.tsx` (Line 1147)

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isConnected && address) {
    loadFaucetBalance();
    loadUserLabsBalance();
    loadMarketplaceLabs(); // ‚Üê NEW: Load marketplace on mount
  }
}, [isConnected, address]);
```

**What**: Marketplace loads automatically when user connects wallet

---

## üìä How It Works Now

### **User Flow: Creating and Trading H1 Tokens**

```
1. User creates lab
   ‚Üì
2. Lab added to blockchain (LabCreated event)
   ‚Üì
3. Marketplace auto-refreshes (shows new lab)
   ‚Üì
4. Lab owner deploys bonding curve
   ‚Üì
5. Marketplace auto-refreshes (shows H1 price)
   ‚Üì
6. Any user can buy H1 with LABS tokens
   ‚Üì
7. Marketplace auto-refreshes (shows updated data)
```

### **Data Flow**

```
Blockchain (Base Sepolia)
  ‚îú‚îÄ H1Diamond Contract
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Lab data (name, symbol, domain, owner)
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Curve addresses (labIdToCurve mapping)
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ LabVault Contracts (per lab)
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ TVL data (totalAssets)
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ BondingCurveSale Contracts (per lab)
     ‚îî‚îÄ H1 Price (in LABS)

         ‚Üì
         
fetchAllLabEvents() ‚Üí Blockscout API
         ‚Üì
         
loadMarketplaceLabs()
  ‚îú‚îÄ Fetches lab events
  ‚îú‚îÄ Queries curve addresses
  ‚îú‚îÄ Queries vault TVL
  ‚îî‚îÄ Queries H1 prices
         ‚Üì
         
allLabsForMarketplace state
         ‚Üì
         
UI renders real data
```

## üí° Answers to Your Questions

### **Q1: Are these real onchain H1 tokens or placeholders?**

‚úÖ **REAL ONCHAIN TOKENS NOW!**

- Labs fetched from Blockscout API
- H1 prices fetched from bonding curve contracts
- TVL fetched from vault contracts
- All trading happens on Base Sepolia blockchain

### **Q2: Shouldn't prices be in LABS instead of ETH?**

‚úÖ **YES, AND IT'S FIXED!**

- All prices now shown in **LABS**
- Input placeholder: "Amount in LABS"
- Info text updated to mention LABS
- Smart contract uses LABS for trading

### **Q3: Shouldn't lab creators have H1 tokens already?**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENT BEHAVIOR**: Lab creators DON'T automatically get H1 tokens

**Why**:
- Staked LABS = Lab creation requirement (locked in diamond)
- H1 tokens = Separate purchase (via bonding curve or direct vault deposit)

**To get H1 tokens as creator**:
1. Deploy bonding curve for your lab
2. Buy H1 tokens with additional LABS (just like anyone else)

**Alternative Design** (would require smart contract change):
- Auto-mint initial H1 shares to creator proportional to staked LABS
- Would require updating LABSCoreFacet.createLab()

## üìù Testing the Implementation

### **Test Checklist**

- [ ] Connect wallet to Base Sepolia
- [ ] Create a lab (staking LABS)
- [ ] Verify lab appears in marketplace
- [ ] See "Not Set" H1 price (curve not deployed)
- [ ] Deploy bonding curve (lab owner)
- [ ] Verify H1 price shows in LABS
- [ ] Buy H1 tokens with LABS
- [ ] Verify transaction on Blockscout
- [ ] Verify H1 balance in wallet

### **Expected Results**

1. **New lab appears in marketplace** immediately after creation
2. **H1 Price shows "Not Set"** until curve is deployed
3. **Deploy button only visible** to lab owner
4. **After deployment**, price shows in LABS format (e.g., "0.0015 LABS")
5. **TVL updates** after each LABS deposit
6. **Buy transaction** requires 2 signatures (approve + buy)
7. **Activity log** shows all steps clearly

## üöÄ Next Steps / Future Enhancements

### **Possible Improvements**

1. **Auto-Deploy Bonding Curves**
   - Could auto-deploy curves during lab creation
   - Pro: Immediate trading availability
   - Con: Extra gas cost upfront

2. **Give Creators Initial H1 Shares**
   - Mint H1 tokens proportional to staked LABS
   - Requires smart contract update

3. **Add Sell/Redeem Functionality**
   - Currently only buy is implemented
   - Would need vault redemption flow UI

4. **Show H1 Balances**
   - Display user's H1 token balance per lab
   - Fetch from LabVault.balanceOf(user)

5. **Add Price Charts**
   - Historical price tracking
   - TVL over time graphs

6. **Add Slippage Protection**
   - Currently minSharesOut = 0
   - Add user-configurable slippage tolerance
