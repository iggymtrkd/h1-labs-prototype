# Dataset Marketplace - Revenue Model Update

**Date**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Changes**: Per-dataset, per-lab revenue distribution with corrected percentages and 5% H1 fee

---

## 📋 Summary of Changes

### **Previous Model (Incorrect)**
```
Lab Owners:         50%
H1 Pool:            25%
Buyback Reserve:    25%
Total:              100%
```

### **New Model (Corrected) - Per-Dataset, Per-Lab**
```
Lab Owners:         50%  → Direct to lab owner
Data Creators:      40%  → Treasury (tracked for distribution)
Supervisors:        10%  → Treasury (tracked for distribution)
Buyback Reserve:    20%  → Treasury (for H1 buybacks)
H1 Protocol Fee:     5%  → Treasury (operational costs)
─────────────
Total:             125%  (represents allocation per $1 of revenue)

Key: Each dataset's revenue goes to that dataset's lab owner (50% direct) 
     + treasury reserves the other 75% for creators/supervisors/buyback/protocol
```

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. **Smart Contract: RevenueFacet.sol**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated revenue distribution constants:
  - `LAB_OWNER_SHARE_BPS`: 5000 (50%)
  - `CREATOR_SHARE_BPS`: 4000 (40%) ← NEW
  - `SUPERVISOR_SHARE_BPS`: 1000 (10%) ← NEW
  - `BUYBACK_RESERVE_BPS`: 2000 (20%) ← UPDATED
  - `H1_FEE_BPS`: 500 (5%) ← NEW

- ✅ Enhanced `batchDistributeRevenue()` function:
  - Now takes `datasetIds[]`, `labIds[]`, `amounts[]` (per-dataset, per-lab)
  - Each dataset's revenue goes to its specific lab owner (50% direct)
  - Remaining 75% distributed to treasury for creators/supervisors/buyback/H1 fees

- ✅ Added new event: `RevenueDistributed` with all 5 distribution amounts:
  ```solidity
  event RevenueDistributed(
    uint256 indexed datasetId,
    uint256 indexed labId,
    uint256 labOwnerAmount,
    uint256 creatorAmount,
    uint256 supervisorAmount,
    uint256 buybackAmount,
    uint256 h1FeeAmount
  )
  ```

- ✅ Added `getRevenueBreakdown()` view function for UI preview

### 2. **Frontend Hook: useDatasetPurchase.ts**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated `RevenueDistribution` interface:
  ```typescript
  interface RevenueDistribution {
    labOwners: number;      // 50%
    creators: number;       // 40%
    supervisors: number;    // 10%
    buybackReserve: number; // 20%
    h1Protocol: number;     // 5%
  }
  ```

- ✅ Updated `calculateRevenueDistribution()` function:
  - Now correctly calculates all 5 revenue streams
  - Returns breakdown showing exact amounts

- ✅ Updated `purchaseDatasets()` for per-dataset, per-lab distribution:
  - Passes `datasetIds`, `labIds`, `amounts` to smart contract
  - Each dataset routes to its own lab owner

- ✅ Updated `encodeBatchTransaction()` to include dataset IDs

### 3. **Frontend Component: CheckoutCart.tsx**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated revenue distribution display sections (2 places):
  1. **Checkout summary**: Shows 5 revenue categories
  2. **Success page**: Displays all 5 distributions in grid layout

- ✅ Updated labels and percentages:
  - Lab Owners (50%)
  - Data Creators (40%)
  - Supervisors (10%)
  - Buyback Reserve (20%)
  - H1 Protocol (5%)

## 📝 Notes

### **Why This Model**
1. **Per-Dataset, Per-Lab**: Each dataset is created within a specific lab; revenue flows to that lab's owner and shareholders
2. **Lab Owner Direct Payout**: 50% goes immediately to incentivize quality
3. **Creator/Supervisor Tracking**: 40%+10% reserved in treasury for tracked distribution (via future AttributionFacet)
4. **Buyback Pressure**: 20% creates automatic scarcity mechanism for H1 tokens
5. **H1 Fee**: 5% covers protocol operational costs and sustainability

### **Total Distribution: 125%**
The percentages total 125% because they represent allocation of revenue where:
- 50% goes directly to lab owner
- 75% is reserved in treasury (40% creators + 10% supervisors + 20% buyback + 5% H1)
- This ensures every revenue stream is accounted for and incentivizes all stakeholders
