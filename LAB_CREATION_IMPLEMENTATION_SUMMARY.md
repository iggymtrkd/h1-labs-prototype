## 🔍 What Was Added

### State Variables
```typescript
// Track user's created labs
interface CreatedLab {
  labId: number;
  name: string;
  symbol: string;
  domain: string;
  vaultAddress: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
const [userCreatedLabs, setUserCreatedLabs] = useState<CreatedLab[]>([]);
const [loadingLabs, setLoadingLabs] = useState(false);
```

### Constants for Level Calculation
```typescript
const MIN_STAKE_FOR_LAB = 100_000;        // 100k LABS
const LEVEL1_THRESHOLD = 100_000;         // Level 1: 100k
const LEVEL2_THRESHOLD = 250_000;         // Level 2: 250k
const LEVEL3_THRESHOLD = 500_000;         // Level 3: 500k
```

### Helper Function
```typescript
const calculateLabLevel = (stakedAmount: number): number => {
  if (stakedAmount >= LEVEL3_THRESHOLD) return 3;
  if (stakedAmount >= LEVEL2_THRESHOLD) return 2;
  if (stakedAmount >= LEVEL1_THRESHOLD) return 1;
  return 0;
};
```

### Computed Values
```typescript
const currentStakedAmount = parseFloat(stakedLabs || '0');
const projectedLabLevel = calculateLabLevel(currentStakedAmount);
const canCreateLab = currentStakedAmount >= MIN_STAKE_FOR_LAB;
```

### UI Sections

#### Section 1: Stake Information Box (lines 992-1020)
- Current staked LABS display
- Projected lab level indicator
- Validation warning (if insufficient stake)
- Level threshold reference

#### Section 2: Your Created Labs (lines 1323-1384)
- Section header with count
- Responsive grid of lab cards
- Each card shows: name, symbol, level, ID, domain, created time, vault link
- Hover effects for interactivity

## 🎯 Feature Details

### Minimum Stake Validation

**Validation Logic:**
```typescript
// Before creating lab, check staked balance
const stakedAmount = parseFloat(stakedLabs || '0');
if (stakedAmount < MIN_STAKE_FOR_LAB) {
  const needed = MIN_STAKE_FOR_LAB - stakedAmount;
  toast.error(`Need at least ${MIN_STAKE_FOR_LAB.toLocaleString()} LABS. 
    Please stake ${needed.toLocaleString()} more LABS.`);
  addLog('error', 'Stage 1: Create Lab', `❌ Cannot create lab - only 
    ${stakedAmount.toLocaleString()} LABS staked.`);
  return; // Stop here, don't try to create
}
```

**User Experience:**
- When stake < 100k: Shows red warning box
- Shows exact amount needed: "Please stake 50,000 more LABS"
- Prevents form submission automatically
- Clear error message in toast notification

**Onchain Check:**
- Happens BEFORE transaction is sent
- Saves gas by validating early
- User sees error immediately (no transaction fee)

### Lab Level Display

**Calculation:**
- Staked 100k LABS → Level 1
- Staked 250k LABS → Level 2  
- Staked 500k LABS → Level 3
- Staked < 100k LABS → No Level

**Display Locations:**
1. Stake section: "Projected Lab Level: Level 1"
2. Activity log: "Lab Level 1"
3. Success message: "Lab created with ID: 1 (Level 1)"
4. Lab card: Level badge in top right

**Code Integration:**
```typescript
// Show level in activity log
const labLevel = calculateLabLevel(stakedAmount);
addLog('info', 'Stage 1: Create Lab', 
  `🏗️ STARTING: Create "${labName}" - Lab Level ${labLevel}`);

// Show in success message
toast.success(`Step 1 Complete! Lab created with ID: ${labId} (Level ${labLevel})`);
```

### Your Created Labs Section

**When It Appears:**
- Only when `userCreatedLabs.length > 0`
- Positioned at bottom of page (above progress banner)
- Takes full width with responsive grid

**Grid Layout:**
```typescript
<div className="grid gap-4 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
  {userCreatedLabs.map((lab) => (
    <Card key={lab.labId}>
      {/* Lab card content */}
    </Card>
  ))}
</div>
```

**What Each Card Shows:**
```
┌─ Lab Name          Level X (badge)
├─ (Symbol)
├─ ID: 1
├─ Domain: medical (badge)
├─ Created: 10/22/2025 2:45 PM
└─ Vault: 0x29a7...e83488 ↗
```

**Card Features:**
- Hover effect brightens background
- Level badge in primary color
- Domain badge in outline style
- Vault address is clickable link to block explorer
- Responsive: 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop

**Adding Labs:**
```typescript
// When lab is created, extract details from event and add to array
const newLab: CreatedLab = {
  labId: typeof labId === 'number' ? labId : parseInt(labId),
  name: labName,
  symbol: labSymbol,
  domain: labDomain,
  vaultAddress: vaultAddress,
  createdAt: new Date()
};
setUserCreatedLabs(prev => [newLab, ...prev]); // Most recent first
```

## 🔗 Code Integration

### Smart Contract Integration
- ✅ Uses same LABS token address from config
- ✅ Uses same diamond address for contract calls
- ✅ Calls LABSCoreFacet.createLab()
- ✅ Reads from TestingFacet.getStakedBalance()
- ✅ Parses LabCreated event from logs
- ✅ Extracts vault address from event data

### Event Parsing
```typescript
// Find the LabCreated event
const labCreatedEvent = receipt.logs.find(
  (log: any) => log.topics[0] === ethers.id(
    "LabCreated(uint256,address,string,string,string,address)"
  )
);

// Extract lab ID from topics
const labId = ethers.toNumber(labCreatedEvent.topics[1]);

// Extract vault address from decoded event
const iface = new ethers.Interface(LABSCoreFacet_ABI);
const decoded = iface.parseLog(labCreatedEvent);
const vaultAddress = decoded.args[5]; // 6th parameter
```

## 🏆 Success Criteria Met

✅ **Requirement 1:** "If I try to stake an amount under 100k labs, does it say in UI or onchain that I do not have enough?"
- **Result:** YES - Shows error in UI before transaction, clear message about amount needed

✅ **Requirement 2:** "Does it show in UI that the lab that will be created will be i.e. level 1 because I have i.e. 100k staked?"
- **Result:** YES - Shows "Projected Lab Level" before creating, calculates based on staked amount

✅ **Requirement 3:** "Does it show anywhere my created labs, if not add it at the very bottom of the page, including lab level, name ticker etc?"
- **Result:** YES - "Your Created Labs" section at bottom shows level, name, symbol, domain, creation time, vault link
