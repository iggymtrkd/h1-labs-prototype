  ///   - Testing event emissions and access control

  ///   - Only callable by diamond owner (enforced via LibDiamond.enforceIsContractOwner())
  ///   - No funds are moved or tokens burned/transferred
  ///   - Safe for testing without risk of actual economic impact
  /// 
  /// FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
  ///   In production, this should include:
  ///   - AMM/DEX integration for market buybacks
  ///   - Token burning mechanism
  ///   - Price impact calculations
  ///   - Slippage protection
  ///   - Treasury balance management
  /// 
  /// @param amount The amount of LABS tokens to simulate buying back (for event logging only)
