# 🧬 H1 Labs — Prototype Frontend

### The decentralized gateway between **AI**, **data provenance**, and **human validation**

H1 Labs is building a **provable AI ecosystem** — where every dataset, validator, and model action is transparently tracked and rewarded. This repository hosts the **frontend prototype**, built to demonstrate the core user experience of staking, validation, and ecosystem exploration.

---

## 🌌 Overview
The H1 Labs prototype is a sleek, dark-themed Web3 application showcasing how human and AI systems coexist through a gamified and compliant onchain interface.

- **Design Philosophy:** Elegant minimalism meets kinetic energy.
- **Visual Identity:** Neon gradients (green–purple–blue), interactive glow effects, and smooth transitions.
- **Built for:** Demos, investor presentations, and early integration with Base / Coinbase SDK.
