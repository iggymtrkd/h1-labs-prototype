## Appendix Collection — H1 Labs Protocol
> Status: Aligned with smart contracts as of 2025-10-19

This document restores and compiles all appendix materials lost from the main whitepaper, ensuring a complete and continuous record of the **H1 Labs** technical, economic, and creative architecture.

---

# **Appendix A: Technical Architecture — H1 Smart Contract Diamond Stack**

### **1. Overview: Why Diamond Standard**
The **Diamond Standard (EIP-2535)** allows modular, upgradeable contracts to scale across domains. Each functional area of H1 Labs (credentialing, provenance, compliance, tokenomics) is isolated into a facet, ensuring upgradeability, auditability, and cross-domain independence.

**Benefits:**
- Add or replace compliance logic without redeploying the system.
- Share common storage and governance.
- Maintain decentralized evolution of the protocol.

---

### **2. Prototype Phase**
**Goal:** Deliver a working demo of staking, Lab creation, and H1 token minting.

**Architecture:**
```
H1Diamond.sol
 ├─ DiamondCutFacet.sol
 ├─ DiamondLoupeFacet.sol
 ├─ OwnershipFacet.sol
 └─ LABSCoreFacet.sol
```

**Core Contracts (current):**
| Contract | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| LABSToken.sol | ERC-20 governance token |
| H1Diamond.sol | Core proxy routing to facets |
| LABSCoreFacet.sol | Handles staking and Lab creation (auto-deploys LabVault) |
| LabVault.sol | Per-lab ERC20 shares; the H1 token auto-deployed at lab creation |

**Logic Flow:**
- `stakeLABS(amount)` transfers LABS into the diamond and updates the caller's staked balance (no NFT minted at stake-time).
- `createLab(name, symbol, domain)` auto-deploys the LabVault (the lab’s H1 token) with defaults.

**Prototype UI:** Wallet connect, staking dashboard, Lab creation wizard.

---

### **3. MVP Phase**
**Goal:** Enable full onchain economy — provenance, validation, revenue distribution.

**Expanded Diamond:**
```
H1Diamond.sol
 ├─ ProvenanceFacet.sol
 ├─ CredentialFacet.sol
 ├─ RevenueFacet.sol
 ├─ ComplianceFacet.sol
 └─ TreasuryFacet.sol
```

**Facets:**
| Facet | Function | Example |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| ProvenanceFacet | Records dataset hashes | `logDataset(hash, validator, domain)` |
| CredentialFacet | Validates credential NFTs | `checkCredential(validator, domain)` |
| RevenueFacet | Handles dataset sale splits | `distributeRevenue(labId, amount)` |
| ComplianceFacet | Domain-specific rules | `enforceCompliance(labId, domain)` |
| TreasuryFacet | Buybacks and staking rewards | `autoBuyback(amount)` |

**Example Revenue Distribution (current, payable ETH):**
```solidity
function distributeRevenue(uint256 labId) external payable {
    uint256 amount = msg.value;
    uint256 labOwner = (amount * 50) / 100;
    uint256 h1Pool   = (amount * 25) / 100;
    uint256 buyback  = amount - labOwner - h1Pool;
    payable(labs[labId].owner).transfer(labOwner);
    payable(protocolTreasury).transfer(h1Pool);
    // buyback is retained for future execution (no automatic buyback yet)
}
```

**MVP UI:** Validator portal, dataset registry, provenance log, staking dashboard.

---

### **4. Post-MVP Phase**
**Goal:** Add governance, cross-chain compliance, fiat abstraction, and DAO.

**Additional Facets:**
```
DAOFacet.sol
ComplianceOracleFacet.sol
CreditAdapterFacet.sol
GrantFacet.sol
NFTCredentialFacet.sol
CrossChainFacet.sol
```

**Roles:**
| Facet | Function |
|--------|-----------|
| DAOFacet | Governance proposals + voting |
| ComplianceOracleFacet | Connects to jurisdiction data feeds |
| CreditAdapterFacet | Converts fiat credits → H1 tokens |
| GrantFacet | Rewards validators/labs with grants |
| NFTCredentialFacet | Credential NFTs via AEH verification |
| CrossChainFacet | Bridges to L2s and sidechains |

---

### **5. Shared Storage Example**
```solidity
struct Lab {
  address owner;
  address h1Token;
  string domain;
  uint256 totalStaked;
  uint256 totalRevenue;
  bool active;
}

struct H1Storage {
  mapping(uint256 => Lab) labs;
  mapping(address => bool) credentialedValidators;
  uint256 nextLabId;
}
```

---

### **6. UI / API Roadmap**
| Stage | Feature | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Prototype | Staking dashboard | Stake LABS, create Labs |
| MVP | Provenance registry | Validators log datasets |
| Post-MVP | SDK + Credits | App integrations, fiat abstraction |

---

### **7. Summary Table**
| Stage | Focus | Layers | Deliverable |
|--------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Prototype | LABS + Lab creation | Core + Factory | Launch token + Labs |
| MVP | Provenance, Revenue | Compliance + Treasury | Full onchain data economy |
| Post-MVP | DAO, SDK, Cross-chain | DAO + Oracles + NFT Credentials | Governance & enterprise-grade |

# **Appendix G: Credentialing and Whitelabel Architecture**

### **1. Credentialing Portal Overview**
Credentialing ensures validators and professionals are verified before contributing to data enrichment or AI supervision.

**Portal Features:**
- ID and license upload (KYC-lite).
- Resume / Curriculum import (LinkedIn or manual).
- Domain credential NFTs (via NFTCredentialFacet).
- Optional background verification through third-party APIs.

### **2. Credential Lifecycle**
```
Apply → Verify → Mint Credential NFT → Validate / Enrich Data → Earn + Reputation → Renew
```

**Validators can:**
- Earn per validated dataset.
- Build a portfolio of credentials across domains.

### **3. Courses & Upskilling**
- In partnership with AEH, launch micro-certification courses for emerging AI/health professionals.
- Graduates earn onchain credentials linked to their H1 validator profiles.

### **4. Whitelabel App Integration**
Some SDK-integrated apps may choose to hide blockchain terminology to reduce friction.

**Architecture:**
```
H1 SDK → CreditAdapterFacet → Fiat Gateway → Token Pool → Validator Reward Contract
```

**Legal Framework:**
- “Credits” act as front-end abstraction of H1 Tokens.
- Onchain transactions remain transparent and auditable.
- Compliant with U.S. FinCEN and SEC guidance if credits are non-transferable and non-speculative.

### **5. Benefits**
- Regulatory friendliness for mainstream audiences.
- Encourages institutional adoption.
- Preserves token buy pressure through backend conversions.

# **Appendix H: Blockchain + AI Synergy Thesis**

### **1. Why Blockchain Matters for AI**
| Challenge | Blockchain Benefit |
|------------|--------------------|
| Data Provenance | Immutable audit trail via provenance facet |
| Attribution | Onchain ownership mapping |
| Compliance | Programmable enforcement (HIPAA, GDPR, C2PA) |
| Trust | Verifiable signatures on enriched data |
| Interoperability | Shared standard across all Atlas domains |

### **2. Economic Flywheel (ASCII)**
```
Data Creation → Validation → Onchain Proof → Dataset Sale → Buyback → Token Appreciation → New Labs
```

### **3. Provable Training & Transparency**
Every enrichment and validation is tied to an onchain record, making it possible to:
- Audit who enriched a dataset.
- Verify which credentialed professionals contributed.
- Validate dataset lineage for regulators and buyers.

### **4. Comparative Edge**
H1 Labs vs. centralized AI firms:
- Centralized: opaque, unverifiable datasets.
- H1: transparent, regulated, token-aligned human participation.

### **5. Strategic Message**
> **“Blockchain gives AI memory, accountability, and provenance — H1 gives it humanity.”**
